				<p>I am the youngest of 5 girls in my family. I only have half siblings, but I consider them just my sisters. All my sisters are 20 or older and I am still down here at 15. This is a good and a bad thing. It is good because the two sisters that live with me, are currently in college, so it is just me and my mom at home. My parents are divorced, so it has always been just us girls. Here is a little bit about each of my sisters:
					<li>Alexis, the oldest, is 25 years old. She has a baby girl, my niece, named Amelia Mae. She is one of my half sisters on my dad's side. My dad and his previous wife had Alexis and my other sister Ashley while my dad still lived in Ohio. My dad the moved down here after meeting my mom online, so Alexis still lives close to her mom in Ohio, but we do get to visit a lot.</li>
					<li>Ashley, the second oldest, is 23 years old. She, like my sister Alexis, still lives in Ohio with her mom. She also gets to visit with us quite a lot.</li>
					<li>Jessica, the oldest on my mom's side, is 21 years old and attends Mansfield University. She still lives at home when she is not at college. She is going for a degree in Music Education and plans to go to New York to get a degree in performance as well.</li>
					<li>Lindsey, the second oldest on my mom's side, is 20 years old and attends Shippensburg University. She co-rents a house with one of her friends up in Shippensburg, so she doesn't come home on breaks, but does come for occasional visits.</li></p>
				<h3>Mom and Dad</h3>
				<p>My mom has lived in or around Duncanon, Pennslyvania her entire life. My dad, on the other hand, used to live in Ohio. My mom and dad met online on a game call Tumble Bees. They started talking in chat and then that lead to texting. Then started dating, and my dad would come and visit my mom from time to time, and my mom would visit him. My dad would have moved here sooner, but his mom was very sick and he didn't want to leave her in a time of need. Once, she passed away, my mom told my dad that she was pregnant with me, and my dad moved down here. Once I was born, my parents waited a while, but eventually got married in 2007.</p>
